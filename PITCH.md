# Elevator Pitch

ESOTools is a CLI utility I wrote to help manage ESO Addons

It features:

- Single command to backup your SavedVariables files to a ZIP archive
- Create a listing of your AddOns in a selectable output format (i.e. markdown, JSON, etc.)
- Check for and list any missing AddOn dependencies
  - Includes optional dependencies upon request
  - [Coming Soon] Optionally download and install missing dependencies
- Check and list any extraneous SavedVariable files (such as those leftover from uninstalled AddOns) and can optionally remove them
- More features coming in future releases

More info on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/dyoung522/esotools), including instructions on how to install and detailed documentation for its use.

I started this as a way to share compiled lists of AddOns, but it's since grown to include checking for missing dependencies and check for left-over SavedVariables.

Ultimately, I'd like to make this a fully-featured ESO AddOn Manager (you can see what I'm planning in the [project's TODO list](https://github.com/dyoung522/esotools/blob/main/TODO.md))

I've been a developer for over 30 years and this is my pet project to learn Go. It is, and will remain, open-source. Any feedback and/or help is absolutely welcome.
