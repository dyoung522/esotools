# ESO Tools TO-DO list

Planned features for upcoming releases.

## Near Term

- [ ] Auto-discover ESO_HOME directory (only fail if it cannot be determined)
- [ ] Search/Install new AddOns (initially from ESO-UI but maybe other sources as well -- configurable?)
- [ ] Ability to "auto-install" missing dependencies (`--install` flag?)

## Long Term

### Desktop Application (GUI)

A separate desktop application with full Mod Manager capabilities

- [ ] Fully configurable
  - [ ] ESO_HOME directory
  - [ ] Archive directory -- where any archive ZIP files should be created
  - [ ] Cache directory -- where we should download AddOn files during install
- [ ] Manage AddOns
- [ ] Manage SavedVariable Files
  - [ ] View SavedVariable file contents
  - [ ] Edit SavedVariable files
- [ ] Ability to have AddOn "profiles" which can be saved/swapped -- this would allow a user to create a "set" of AddOns and/or SavedVariables to be used for individual game sessions (unsure how useful this would be?)
